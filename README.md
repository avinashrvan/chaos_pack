Hi, and welcome to my intro Vue.js project. I got bored and decided to add one or two fun features to the page. Try double clicking the price cards, or even try double clicking the second section of the page. 
```

## Project setup

npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production

npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
